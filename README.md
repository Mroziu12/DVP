# Job Market Analytics

This is our project for the Data Visualization course at University of Genoa. We scraped job offers from JustJoin.it (a Polish job board) and made some visualizations to analyze the IT job market. The main page shows a network graph of skills that appear together in job postings, plus some charts about salaries and experience levels. You can click on any skill to see more details about it. We used Python for data processing (cleaning the data, converting salaries to EUR, categorizing skills with some ML stuff) and JavaScript with D3.js for the visualizations. The data processing pipeline is explained on the data-processing.html page if you're interested.
